What Does tinydown Support
--------------------------

Initially ideated to write markdown on blogger or other online platforms, this fully tested parser can do the following:

  * lists, like this one, both ordered and / or unordered with
    the possibility to go new line preserving the list item
  * _em_ and __strong__ with both * and _ form
  * paragraphs to keep the semantic right
  * blockquotes and nested block quotes
  * links and images
  * youtube embedded videos
  * gists from github, hacking the `document.write` like a boss so you can do that on the fly regardless
  * hr, br, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6
  * code blocks, inline blocks, and tick box
  * basically all you can do with markdown in a sort of simplified way

You can also try [the test page](http://webreflection.github.io/tinydown/test/test.html) able to show this own layout on the fly.
